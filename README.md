# Fix AMD Discord
### [Leia em PT-BR ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·](https://github.com/Hachi-R/Fix-AMD-Discord-CLI/blob/main/READMEBRAZIL.md)
### Fix AMD Discord is a tool designed to address specific issues with Discord on AMD processors, such as:

- Crashes when joining voice calls;
- Crashes when watching screen broadcasts;
- Crashes when screen broadcasting.

#### These issues are related to the [Math Kernel Library (MKL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_Kernel_Library), which, on some Hackintosh AMD processors, some applications, including Discord and Adobe software, attempt to use Intel-specific functions. This can result in system failures.

#### The Fix AMD Discord modifies the `MKL_DEBUG_CPU_TYPE` environment variable so that MKL uses the appropriate functions for AMD CPUs.

##### Note: This fix should also resolve issues in Adobe software, although I have not tested it.

# Installation
